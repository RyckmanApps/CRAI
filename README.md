# Overview
Collision Repair AI is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the collision repair industry. We leverage cutting-edge business intelligence (BI) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction for Multi-Shop Operators (MSOs).

## Features
### Customer Communication Like Never Before
LLM chatbots trained on your company's data keep customers informed and engaged throughout the repair process. Our system uses AI-driven sentiment analysis to tailor responses and ensure a positive customer experience. We use efficient prompt engineering to minimize token usage and API costs so customers can have lengthy AI-driven conversations with your custom-trained AI Agents. 5-Star "Kept Informed" CSI scores costs less per repair order than a tube of seam sealer using chatbots that pass the Turing Test.

### Invoice Document Processing
Our AI-powered document processing system automatically extracts and validates critical information from invoices, significantly reducing manual entry errors and improving overall efficiency. Real-time AI invoicing leads to real-time visability of operational margins. No longer wait until overburdened and error-prone staff enter invoices.

### Estimator and Repair Planner Augmentation
Using cutting-edge LLMs, fine-tuned and prompt-engineered using our algorithms, collision repair estimators and repair planners can now be augmented with top-shelf AI technologies. Into the language model goes context regarding the repairs and out comes expert advice and documentation for estimators. The level of detail and supporting documentation ensures your estimates are rarely rejected by insurance company AI screening tools.

Additionally, repair planners and parts procurement teams can use AI-guided planning, purchasing, and forecasting. By using RPA+AI to continuously monitor parts procurement and tracking activities, technicians have AI working tirelessly around the clock to procure and secure the needed parts and materials for every repair.

## Data Analytics & Visualization
We build custom data models tailored to your business, enabling us to create powerful Business Intelligence (BI) tools that provide actionable insights. By analyzing your data, we can identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement that can significantly enhance your operations. We guarantee that the insights derived from our data analysis will pay for our consulting fees by an order of magnitude.

### Consulting & Implementation

### Seamless Integration
Our solutions integrate seamlessly with leading management systems adhering to CEICA BMS standards and utilizing APIs to ensure smooth data exchange and automated workflows. When convenient endpoints are not available we use Power Apps to ingest on-premises data and incorporate it into Microsoft Fabric.

For collision repairers and MSOs, these insights could include identifying bottlenecks in the repair process, optimizing resource allocation, predicting future workloads, and enhancing customer communication strategies. Our BI tools present these insights in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format, empowering you to make data-driven decisions quickly and confidently.

### Microsoft Power Apps
Power Apps allows us to build custom applications that address unique challenges in your business, streamlining processes and improving user experiences. For collision repairers, Power Automate can interact with your CCC One desktop, just like an estimator.

### AI Tools
Our solutions use sentiment analytics to understand customer emotions and tailor responses accordingly, ensuring a more personalized experience. We also offer image processing capabilities to analyze and process images of damaged vehicles, streamlining the estimation and repair processes. Our AI-driven text-to-code feature generates code snippets based on natural language input, accelerating the development of custom applications and integrations.
